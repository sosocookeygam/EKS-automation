This deployment file creates a deployment for a containerized application, and also creates a HorizontalPodAutoscaler 
resource that enables autoscaling based on CPU utilization.

The spec.replicas field in the deployment spec sets the initial number of replicas to 2, 
which can be adjusted based on your requirements. The resources field in the container spec 
defines the CPU and memory requests and limits for the container.

The HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource defines the scaling behavior for the deployment. 
The scaleTargetRef field specifies the deployment that the HPA will scale. The minReplicas 
and maxReplicas fields define the minimum and maximum number of replicas that the HPA can scale to. 
The metrics field specifies the type of metric that the HPA should use to scale, which in this case is CPU utilization.

With this deployment file, your application will automatically scale up or down 
based on CPU utilization, with a minimum of 2 replicas and a maximum of 5 replicas.
